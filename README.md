# LaxativeJS
Simple Parallax For Your Sites. It *runs* quite nicely!


### Local Dev
I'm currently using https://parceljs.org/ to work locally.


### Production Use
It can certainly be used for pruction, but it's still a work in progress.
Once ready, an NPM package will be released as well as a nice script that can be dropped into your sites.


### What's in a name
I was very tired when I started working on this. So I pulled lax out of Parallax and created Laxative. A name change could come down the line in the future.
