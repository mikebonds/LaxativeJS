# Plax.js
Simple Parallax For Your Sites. It *runs* quite nicely!


### Local Dev
I'm currently using https://parceljs.org/ to work locally.


### Production Use
It can certainly be used for production, but it's still a work in progress.
Once ready, an NPM package will be released as well as a nice script that can be dropped into your sites.
